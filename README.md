##Scope
The success of your Rock Paper Scissors game has prompted your old employer, Old Games, New Programs LLC, to ask you to create
another game for them. This time the game they have requested is the Memory game. The memory game is a game where a player is prompted to select a card and then find it's matching card within the next card. If a matching card is found, both cards remain face up, otherwise the cards are flipped back around and the process starts all over again.

* The game will be a 1 player game.
